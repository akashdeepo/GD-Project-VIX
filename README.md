# 📊 Google Search Sentiment & Market Volatility

This repository contains the code, data processing pipeline, and visualizations for our research on using Google search trends as an early-warning signal for financial market volatility (VIX spikes).

## 🔍 Overview

We study how public search behavior — particularly terms like “Recession”, “Financial Crisis”, and “Market Crash” — correlates with and often precedes spikes in market volatility.

Using:
- Google Trends data (2004–2025)
- VIX index data (2000–2024)
- Gold price data for safe-haven analysis

We build:
- A composite sentiment index (via PCA)
- A feature-rich dataset with rate-of-change and anomaly scores
- A machine learning model (XGBoost) to forecast VIX spikes
- A scoring-based **Early Warning System**

## 📈 Key Results

- **3.1× lift** in predicting VIX spikes within 1 month using sentiment anomalies
- Top terms (“Recession”, “Financial Crisis”) show **r > 0.65** correlation with VIX
- Gold prices tend to rise during peak fear periods
- Early-warning system achieved:
  - ROC AUC: **0.825**
  - F1 Score: **0.618**

## 🧠 Tech Stack

- Python, pandas, matplotlib, seaborn
- XGBoost, PCA, z-score anomaly detection
- Jupyter notebooks for reproducibility

## 🚀 Getting Started

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/vix-sentiment-warning.git
